# Project Name: Ligand-to-Metal Charge-Transfer dynamics in TiCat3
![TiCat3_2_16_bold](https://github.com/lemonballad/LMCT_TiCat3_UNC-CH/assets/42358343/843c63c1-d769-4332-8e06-28bf53e890ea)

This repository contains code for a project that leveraged experimental and synthetic/simulated data to elucidate the charge transfer dynamics of a small molecule meant to be a toy model for molecule-semiconductor interfaces. The code is provided in two versions: MATLAB and Python.

## Folder Structure
### matlab:
This folder contains the original MATLAB files for the project.
### python:
This folder contains the converted Python files for the project.

## Dependencies
### MATLAB:
MATLAB 2016

### Python:
re:        regular expressions operations

## Usage
### MATLAB & Python:
Many of the original files are no longer accessible and much of the code cannot be run without it. I will add instructions on usage if this changes in the future.

## Converting Between MATLAB and Python
The Python code in the python folder was converted from the original MATLAB code in the matlab folder.
The conversion process involved selecting pythonic substitutes for MATLAB built-in functions.

## Contributing
This project has ended. The purpose of this repository is to archive some of the work that was done.
